# 👋 Hi, I'm Abass Owolabi — Python Developer & Web Scraping Enthusiast

I studied Microbiology at Adekunle Ajasin University, but I’ve always been drawn to tech. After graduation, I felt stuck—no job, no clear direction, and like my degree wasn’t enough.

Back in school, I ran a clothing business selling men’s wear online and even had a physical shop. But I wanted more—a skill I could carry anywhere. I’ve always dreamed of working from anywhere in the world. That’s when I started seriously exploring tech.

I discovered Python in late 2024 and saw it as the key to everything I was looking for: automation, web scraping, and eventually blockchain development.

## 📚 What I've Learned So Far

I began with [Mosh Hamedani’s free Python course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc) in December 2024, which gave me a strong Python foundation and introduced me to building simple websites with Django.

Then I completed the **Python for Everybody** specialization on Coursera, earning these certificates:

[![Python Data Structures](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python_Data_Structures-blue?style=flat-square)](https://coursera.org/share/7e9c12e3b720c8b2585a3b27b8890b6e)  
[![Using Python to Access Web Data](https://img.shields.io/badge/Using_Python_to_Access_Web_Data-blue?style=flat-square)](https://coursera.org/share/2bd0d172fa34691daa4477d89e5fca4e)

In May 2025, I completed this Udemy course to deepen my web scraping skills:

[![Scrapy Course](https://img.shields.io/badge/Scrapy_Web_Scraping-Udemy-red?style=flat-square)](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-96e67cbc-ddfc-43ba-b241-c04f25f333cc/)

These courses gave me a strong foundation in Python, web APIs, and data extraction—skills I now use in real-world projects.
